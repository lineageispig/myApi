# How to use

•First, clone the project to your desktop.

•Second, open your terminal and cd to the file.

•Third, using node to open the server(I use 8080).

•Next, open your browser and type http://localhost:8080/.

•Last, type starting point and ending point of the location.

•The server should have run START, DROPOFF, DISTANCE, DURATION.

(It is not the perfect version.)
